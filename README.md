# Leaderboard Task API

This project consists of a backend API built with NestJS and a frontend application built with React and Vite. The backend provides efficient and scalable server-side functionality, while the frontend offers a responsive user interface.

---

## Backend

The backend is built using the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.

### Setup

Navigate to the `backend` directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Running the Backend

You can run the backend in different modes:

- Development mode (with hot reload):

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

- Production mode:

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

- Default start:

```bash
npm run start
```

### Testing

Run unit and end-to-end tests:

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:cov
```

---

## Frontend

The frontend is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool.

### Setup

Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Running the Frontend

Start the development server with hot module replacement:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
npm start
```
